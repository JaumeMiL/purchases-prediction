# 2023 Purchases Prediction: Clinical and Sanitary Products
## A Datathon Challenge by NTT Data

### Overview
In the fast-paced world of healthcare, the efficient distribution of clinical and sanitary products is vital. Our team, comprised of Roger Baiges, Adrià Flores, Jaume Mora, and Cai Selvas, has developed a robust model using time series analysis to predict the purchasing trends of these essential products for 2023. By focusing on the temporal dynamics, our model is not only poised to accurately forecast for 2023 but is also scalable for future years.

### Highlights
- **Time Series Analysis**: Leveraging ARIMA models, we delve into the temporal patterns to forecast future purchases.
- **High Accuracy Achieved**: Our models have demonstrated remarkable precision with an R-squared value exceeding 0.82, indicating a strong correlation between our predictions and the actual data.
- **Datathon Excellence**: Crafted during a competitive datathon, this project is a testament to innovative data science applied to real-world challenges.

### Execution
To replicate our analysis or dive deeper into our findings:
1. Open the provided Python interactive notebook.
2. Execute all cells to see the analyses, plots, and insights that underpin our predictions.

### Results
Our efforts culminated in a model that not only predicts with high accuracy but also provides actionable insights for inventory management and logistic optimization. The R-squared values of over 0.82 for purchase quantity and 0.87 for unit price prediction underline the model's efficacy.

### Environmental Impact and Ethical Considerations
In line with NTT Data's commitment to sustainability, our project aligns with ethical standards and considers the environmental impact of the healthcare supply chain.

### Acknowledgements
We extend our gratitude to NTT Data for organizing the datathon, providing us with a platform to showcase our skills and contribute to the healthcare sector.
